This AOP-like library allows you to instrument methods in your code for collecting and storing performance statistics easily.

You don't have to make any changes to your code, or you can annotate which methods you want to instrument.
The library uses low-latency and GC-free techniques, to avoid being detrimental to your application's performance.
